**Project Name:** ZRYPTII

**Description:**
ZRYPTII is a mobile application designed to open and view any file in read-only mode while functioning fully offline. In the future, the app will incorporate a cloud-based feature for file analysis with isolated storage for better security.

### **Requirements Document**

#### **1. Platform Compatibility:**
- The app should be developed using Flutter to support both Android and iOS platforms.
- The initial release should focus on Android, with iOS support planned for future updates.

#### **2. Core Functionalities:**
- Ability to open and view various file formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPT, XLS, images, and videos) in read-only mode.
- Ensure no modifications can be made to opened files.
- Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for selecting and opening files.
- Allow users to navigate through files smoothly with zoom, scroll, and search functionalities where applicable.

#### **3. Offline Capability:**
- The app should function entirely offline, meaning all file operations must be local.
- No internet connection should be required for core features.

#### **4. Security & Permissions:**
- The app should request only necessary permissions, such as file access.
- Implement strict read-only access to prevent accidental edits or modifications.
- Ensure that user data remains private and no unnecessary background operations occur.

#### **5. Future Development (Cloud Feature for File Analysis):**
- Plan for a cloud feature where users can upload files for analysis.
- Implement isolated storage for secure cloud interactions.
- Ensure user data privacy with encryption and secure authentication mechanisms.

#### **6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):**
- Clean and minimalistic UI with easy navigation.
- Dark mode and light mode support.
- Display file details (name, size, type, last modified date, etc.).
- Error handling and proper messaging for unsupported file types.

#### **7. Performance & Optimization:**
- Ensure quick file loading and smooth user interactions.
- Optimize memory usage for handling large files efficiently.
- Implement caching where necessary to improve performance.

#### **8. Testing & Deployment:**
- Provide an APK build for testing on physical devices.
- Ensure compatibility with various Android versions.
- Conduct testing to verify offline functionality and read-only restrictions.

### **Prompt for Cursor AI**

> Build a Flutter mobile app named ZRYPTII that can open and view any file in read-only mode. The app should work fully offline and support various file formats like PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPT, XLS, images, and videos. It must not allow file modifications. Implement a minimal UI with file selection, navigation, and security measures to restrict editing. Future updates will add cloud-based file analysis with isolated storage. Provide an APK build for testing.
